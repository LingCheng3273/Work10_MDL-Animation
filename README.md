# Work10_MDL-Animation

I can't check if the makefile works because I'm on a Windows computer. 
If it doesn't work, run main.py and enter 'simple_anim.mdl' to run the file.

The code creates the PPM files in the 'anim' folder, 
but the gif doesn't show up for me.
Not sure if it's because of my code or my computer.
